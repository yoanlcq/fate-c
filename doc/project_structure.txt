Note : let the <target> variable be one of :
    linux64
    linux32
    osx
    windows32
    windows64


bin/<target> :
    The executables and .dll directory.

build/<target> :
    Temporary files resulting from the project's building process.
    This directory is not to be delivered with games (duh!)

data/ :
    Maybe it would be best named "userdata".
    This directory must contain everything that would vary between users.
    Exemples would be config files, saves, precompiled shader binaries, 
    extensions, etc.
    Not to be confused with res/.

data/OpenGL/
    Most often cache files from the OpenGL backend.

doc/ :
    Well duh.

include/ :
    All header files, including some embedded 3rd-party libraries headers.

lib/<target> :
    Dynamically-loaded libraries go here, whether or not they are 3rd party.
    Mods should, however, go under data/mods/<target>.

res/ :
    Read like "resources".
    This directory must contain everything that would vary between games.
    Exemples would be 3D models, shaders, fonts, etc.
    Not to be confused with data/.

src/ :
    All source files. Also named "No header file's land".

experiments/ :
    People could call it "spikes" or "tests". Well, it's both plus anything 
    you want. This is where anyone can put works-in-progress or anything that 
    might be of interest to the internal developers. There's no convention in 
    there, and code is not really required to be well-written.
