- requires : 'time', and 'schema' to save the _whole_ state.
- remember(time) Stores the current state in the slot given by 'time'.
  Remembering the future is useless, unless you want general-purpose storage.
- forget(time) Deletes the state in the slot given by 'time'.
- time_travel(time) Loads the state from the slot given by 'time'.
  Actually, at each new tick, systems call time_travel(tick+1) which updates
  the entity for the next tick.
  So calling time_travel(tick+N) causes the entity to be updated N times.
  Travelling to a forgotten past is an error, because by definition, the
  past has already been computed and supposedly kept in memory.
