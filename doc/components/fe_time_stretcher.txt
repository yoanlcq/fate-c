- requires : 'time_traveller', to use the time_travel() call to interpolate
  between states.
- derivate_traveller(time_traveller) this time_stretcher is a velocity.
- derivate_stretcher(time_stretcher) for acceleration, jerk, etc.
- time_stretch(value) Sets the stretch value.
  You're responsible for remember()ing enough state when using negative values.
  There will never be premade mechanisms for this. You're supposed to know
  exactly what you're doing.
