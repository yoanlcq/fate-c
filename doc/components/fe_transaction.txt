A fe_transaction is an abstraction for a hardware memory transaction.
It is an alternative to mutexes where memory writes are a concern. 

If necessary, it fallbacks to a either a software transactional memory 
implementation or a lightweight mutex.

Unlike mutexes, they do not guarantee that two threads won't be executing
the same code at the same time, so it can't be used reliably to, say,
ensure mutual exclusion between Vulkan API calls.
