Note : let the <target> variable be one of :
    linux64
    linux32
    windows32
    windows64
    osx
    web


bin/<target> :
    The executables and shared libraries directory.

build/<target> :
    Temporary files resulting from the project's building process.
    This directory is not to be delivered with games (duh!)

data/ :
    Maybe it would be best named "userdata".
    This directory must contain everything that would vary between users.
    Exemples would be config files, saves, precompiled shader binaries, 
    extensions, etc.
    Not to be confused with res/.

data/OpenGL/
    Most often cache files from the OpenGL backend.

doc/ :
    Well duh.

include/ :
    All header files.

include/contrib/ :
    3rd party header files.
    In source code, there's no need to write
    #include <contrib/foolib.h>
    But instead :
    #include <foolib.h>

res/ :
    Read like "resources".
    This directory must contain everything that would vary between games.
    Exemples would be 3D models, shaders, fonts, etc.
    Not to be confused with data/.

src/ :
    All source files, Aka "No header file's land".
