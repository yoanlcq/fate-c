---- Spacetime and The Scheduler

---- The FST format
An FST source file contains a list of States.
A State contains a list of Callbacks.
A Callback contains these Blocks, in any order :
    -&gt; A "do" Block;
    -&gt; Optionally, a "to" Block;
    -&gt; Optionally, a "when" Block;

---- Preprocessor

#insert "file"

#replace
text

some more text
#by
replaced text here
#end

Useful definitions :

#replace
yes 
#by
1
#end
#replace
no
#by
0
#end

#replace
mul({{a}},{{b}})
#by
({{a}}*{{b}})
#end

mul(2,3) =&gt; (2*3)

---- Path resolution
In FST, all nodes (i.e the Lnode, as well as all of the Vnodes, Enodes and
their variables) are located in the Global Tree, in a parent-children
relationship. 
One can think of the Global Tree as a true filesystem, except
that each directory is a file at the same time.
The Tree structure has shown its efficiency for years :
    -&gt; You use it everyday to manage your data and access resources;
    -&gt; UNIX's "Everything is a file" philosophy makes programming on this
       platform quite easier. You need and interface to the System's Kernel,
       and you know there is a file for it you can read and write to 
       (note that that file can be virtual);
    -&gt; In programming languages, functions can be thought of as nodes that
       carry their own value and can call other nodes (The "main" function
       being the root node);
    -&gt; That's what Object-Oriented Programming is about, after all;
    -&gt; You can locate nodes by their absolute position in the hierarchy 
       (eg. A global counter) or their relative position to the current node
       (eg. The chest near to your hero).
    -&gt; You can rearrange nodes as they move into the world.
    -&gt; This allows creating a game world like this :
       Universe
       `- Galaxy_0
          `- SubGalaxy_0
          `- SubGalaxy_1
          `- Solar_System
             `- Venus
             `- Earth
                `- Continents
                `- Seas
                   `- Lost_Island
                      `- Hero
             `- Jupiter
          `- SubGalaxy_N
       `- Galaxy_1
       `- Galaxy_N
    -&gt; Need to share files ? Use a Network FileSystem.
       Need online multiplayer ? Do this with nodes.
    -&gt; All the filesystem goodies come in, such as Symbolic Links 
       (weak references) and Hard Links (strong references with 
       reference counting)

The following explains the semantics of a Path in FST's Global Tree.

Node names
Node names are strings of only alphanumerical characters from the UTF-8
character set. Underscores ('_') are allowed. No name may have less than one
alphabetic character.
The user is advised to stick to the following convention :
-&gt; User-created node names should start with an uppercase letter, as each word following it should do.
-&gt; Names consisting of no uppercase letter should be left for the Scheduler.

No node name may be one of these reserved names :

statelabel
random
x
y
z
time
rotation
scale
vel
accel
targets
&lt;number value&gt;
on
off
yes
no
true
false

Which are ordered like so :
MyEnode
`- x           &lt;= MyEnode's x axis's offset (relative to its parent's).
   `- vel      &lt;= MyEnode's x axis's offset's velocity.
   `- accel    &lt;= MyEnode's x axis's offset's velocity's velocity.
   `- rotation &lt;= MyEnode's rotation around its x axis.
      `- vel   &lt;= MyEnode's rotation's velocity around its x axis.
      `- accel &lt;= MyEnode's rotation's velocity's velocity around its x axis.
   `- scale    &lt;= MyEnode's x axis's scale.
      `- vel   &lt;= MyEnode's x axis's scale's velocity.
      `- accel &lt;= MyEnode's x axis's scale's velocity's velocity.
`- y           &lt;= MyEnode's y axis's offset (relative to its parent's).
   `- vel      &lt;= MyEnode's y axis's offset's velocity.
   `- accel    &lt;= MyEnode's y axis's offset's velocity's velocity.
   `- rotation &lt;= MyEnode's rotation around its y axis.
      `- vel   &lt;= MyEnode's rotation's velocity around its y axis.
      `- accel &lt;= MyEnode's rotation's velocity's velocity around its y axis.
   `- scale    &lt;= MyEnode's y axis's scale.
      `- vel   &lt;= MyEnode's y axis's scale's velocity.
      `- accel &lt;= MyEnode's y axis's scale's velocity's velocity.
`- z           &lt;= MyEnode's z axis's offset (relative to its parent's).
   `- vel      &lt;= MyEnode's z axis's offset's velocity.
   `- accel    &lt;= MyEnode's z axis's offset's velocity's velocity.
   `- rotation &lt;= MyEnode's rotation around its z axis.
      `- vel   &lt;= MyEnode's rotation's velocity around its z axis.
      `- accel &lt;= MyEnode's rotation's velocity's velocity around its z axis.
   `- scale    &lt;= MyEnode's z axis's scale.
      `- vel   &lt;= MyEnode's z axis's scale's velocity.
      `- accel &lt;= MyEnode's z axis's scale's velocity's velocity.
`- time        &lt;= MyEnode's time axis's offset (relative to its parent's).
   `- vel      &lt;= MyEnode's time axis's offset's velocity.
   `- accel    &lt;= MyEnode's time axis's offset's velocity's velocity.
`- targets     &lt;= Filled by Hard Links to Enodes reached by one or more 
                     of MyEnode's Red HitBoxes in current time position. 
                     These Hard Links are removed at the beginning of the next
                     step in time. MyEnode can copy one or more of them to 
                     a personal node to keep track of them.
`- dnode       &lt;= Hard Link to MyEnode's Dnode.
  

Separator and operators :
-&gt; The '.' symbol is the "child-of" operator.
-&gt; The '^' symbol resolves to the parent node of the previously resolved 
      node in the path.

Prefixes :
-&gt; The absence of prefix means "the current node". 
-&gt; Paths starting with '%' are relative to the Lnode (which is also 
   the root node).
-&gt; Paths starting with ':' are relative to the Root Vnode 
   (it actually resolves to "%.root_vnode").
   To remember it, think of ':' as a pair of eyes ("The view").
   The Root Vnode is shared across the network.
-&gt; Paths starting with '&amp;' are relative to the Root Enode
   (it actually resolves to "%.root_enode").
   To remember it, think of '&amp;' as a weird capital 'E'.
   The Root Enode is shared across the network.
-&gt; Paths starting with '@' are relative to the Root Dnode
   (it actually resolves to "%.root_dnode").
   It is also referred to as the "Aether", where the Entities are loaded but 
   not yet instanciated (aka "brought to existence").
-&gt; Paths starting with '~' are relative to the executable's full path in 
   the user's filesystem. (it actually resolves to "%.app_path").
   The '~' character is used as a shortcut to the home directory on Linux.

Wildcards :
-&gt; The '?' character is replaced at resolution-time by any 
   alphanumerical character.
-&gt; The '*' character is replaced at resolution-time by one or more
   alphanumerical characters.

See examples below :

-&gt; "foo" resolves to the node named "foo" that is a child of the current
   node, as do ".foo", "..foo", "...foo" and "......foo";
-&gt; "&amp;.Earth.Continents" resolves to the node named "Continents" that is 
   a child of the node named "Earth" that is a child of the Root Enode,
   as do "&amp;...Earth..Continents" and "&amp;.Earth.^.Earth.Continents".
-&gt; "^.bar" resolves to the node named "bar" that is a child of the 
    parent node of the current node, as do "...^..bar".
-&gt; "foo*bar" resolves to each node that is a child of the current node, 
    and which name starts with "foo" and ends with "bar", as do "foo**bar" 
    and "foo***bar".
-&gt; "foo?ar" resolves to each node that is a child of the current node, and 
    which name starts with "foo", followed by a single character and "ar".

Access rules :
-&gt; Trying to access a non-existing node will result in creating it with a
   default value. Refer to the following table :

Those are IMMUTABLE !

<h1>Annexes</h1>



<h2>Annex A : FST Preprocessor directives reference</h2>

<h3>File content insertion : #include "filename" directive</h3>
<p>
The <code>#include "filename"</code> directive shall be replaced by 
the content of the file whose path in the User's Filesystem is 
<code>filename</code>. 
The next end-of-line character following such a directive shall be preserved.
<br>
<code>filename</code>'s characters shall be read "as-is", which means, for
instance, that spaces and backslashes are read as they are and lose any 
other meaning.
<br>
<code>filename</code> shall not contain quote characters.
<br>
<code>filename</code> shall be given "as-is" to the User's Operating System,
which will handle path resolution itself. It means, for instance, that slashes
should be placed between a folder's path and a given file or sub-folder of that
folder.
</p>
<p>
The presence of any character other than space between the <code>#include</code> 
token and the <code>"filename"</code> token shall cause an error.
<br>
The presence of any character other than space between the 
<code>"filename"</code> token and the end-of-line shall cause an error.
<br>
A <code>filename</code> pointing to a file that can't be accessed shall cause an error.
<br>
Implementations shall not have the number of levels of inclusion be under a fixed limit.
<br>
However, infinite inclusions shall be detected by implementations and cause 
an error.
(eg. "A.fst" includes "B.fst", and "B.fst" includes "A.fst").
<div class="informative">
    The implementation could detect infinite inclusions by building a directed 
    graph and detecting cycles in it.
</div>
</p>

<h3>Content substitution : #replace, #by</h3>
<p>
The following FST code :
<div class="code_block"><code><pre>
#replace
before
#by
after
#end
</pre></code></div>
shall cause the implementation to treat every occurence of <code>before</code>
at if it was <code>after</code>, for the remaining of the preprocessing step.
<br>
<code>before</code> shall start right after the first end-of-line character 
following the <code>#replace</code> directive, and end right before the last 
end-of-line character preceding the <code>#by</code> directive.
<br>
<code>after</code> shall start right after the first end-of-line character 
following the <code>#by</code> directive, and end right before the last 
end-of-line character preceding the <code>#end</code> directive.
</p>

<h3>User-defined messages : #info, #warn, #error</h3>
<p>
The following FST code :
<div class="code_block"><code><pre>
#info
message
#end
</pre></code></div>
shall be a hint to the implementation to present <code>message</code> to the
user.
<br>
How and when <code>message</code> is presented is up to the implementation.
<div class="informative">
    <code>message</code> could be printed in a special color at the very moment 
    the <code>#end</code> directive is parsed.
</div>
<br>
The <code>#warn</code> and <code>#error</code> directives shall behave 
similarly, except that <code>#error</code> shall cause an error as an additional effect.
<br>
<code>message</code> shall start right after the first end-of-line character 
following the <code>#info</code> directive, and end right before the last 
end-of-line character preceding the <code>#end</code> directive.
</p>


<h2>Annex B : FST State Controllers reference</h2>
<h3>ChangeState</h3>
<p>Causes the target to switch to a given state, and delays its execution 
until the next tick. The old state's execution is interrupted.<p>
Required parameters:
<div class="indent">
    value (State node)
    <div class="indent">
        The new state the target will switch to.
    </div>
</div>
<h3>ExecState</h3>
<p>Causes the target to execute another state.<br>
To be accurate, it does three things :<br>
1) Interrupts the target's current state execution;<br>
2) Changes the target's current state;<br>
3) Executes the new state immediately.<br>
A too frequent use of ExecState is discouraged in favor of ChangeState.<br>
It is only recommended to use it to execute small states that nearly act as functions.<br>
</p>
<h3>Copy</h3>
<p>Description...</p>
Required parameters:
<div class="indent">
    none
</div>
Optional parameters:
<div class="indent">
    depth (32-bit integer)
    overwrite (boolean)
    target (s8) (entry, symlink, hardlink)
    ticket (node)
    <div class="indent">
