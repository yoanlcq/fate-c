 *  \brief MT : Multithreading, Locks/hardware transactional memory, etc.
 *  \defgroup mt MT : Multithreading, Locks/hardware transactional memory, etc.
 *
 * F.A.T.E uses SDL2 as the thread/mutex implementation by default.
 *
 * However, things evolve, and today we have cool things such as
 * Hardware Transactional Memory, which F.A.T.E is able to use instead of
 * regular mutexes, if compiled with the appropriate compile-time switches.
 *
 * This module can also detect deadlocks, if compiled with
 * \c FE_MT_MUTEX_CHECK_DEADLOCKS.<br>
 * In that case, deadlock detection takes place no matter the mutex 
 * implementation (even with Transactional Memory).
 *
 * <b>Compile-time switches :</b>
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>FE_NO_MT</td>
 *     <td>If defined, guarantees a single threaded program, even preventing
 *         creation of other threads at runtime.<br>
 *         Most functionalities provided by this module then become macros that 
 *         expand to nothing, but behaviour is kept consistent.<br>
 *         For instance, #fe_mt_get_num_threads() will expand to 1, as 
 *         expected.<br>
 *         We may want this in case the overhead of having multiple threads
 *         is comparable to the game's workload itself.<br>
 *         Besides, threads are just not supported on Emscripten as of today
 *         (Feb 2016) and Web Workers is not targeted by F.A.T.E.
 *         Thus, on Emscripten, we don't want mutexes to even <i>exist</i>
 *         within the program. On the other hand, a lot of work is said
 *         to be performed asynchronously, but this is not exactly the same 
 *         thing.
 *         </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>FE_MT_MUTEX_CHECK_DEADLOCKS</td>
 *     <td>Check for deadlocks, regardless of the actual mutex implementation.
 *     </td></tr>
 * <tr><td>FE_MT_MUTEX_USE_GNUTM</td>
 *     <td>Compile on GCC with \c -fgnu-tm. The program then depends on
 *         a GCC runtime library called \c libitm.<br>
 *         GNU Transactional Memory is by far the most portable and safe 
 *         choice, but since it may be implemented as regular library calls, 
 *         it is perhaps not more efficient than direct RTM/HLE instructions 
 *         on x86.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>FE_MT_MUTEX_TRY_X86HLE</td>
 *     <td>Compile on GCC with \c -mhle. Has no effect if the target is
 *         not an x86.<br>
 *         HLE (Hardware Lock Elision) is a CPU feature, so support for it
 *         is not known until runtime, hence the \c TRY.<br>
 *         If the target is x86, but HLE is not supported, then
 *         the mutex implementation falls back to SDL2's.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>FE_MT_MUTEX_TRY_X86RTM</td>
 *     <td>Compile on GCC with \c -mrtm. Has no effect if the target is
 *         not an x86.<br>
 *         RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory) is a CPU feature, so 
 *         support for it is not known until runtime, hence the \c TRY.<br>
 *         If the target is x86, but RTM is not supported, then
 *         the mutex implementation falls back to HLE.

 * <h3>FAQ/discussion :</h3>
 * <b>Is OpenMP support considered ?</b><br>
 * No. Even though OpenMP is a very powerful way
 * of parallelizing various sections within code in a safe manner,
 * the problem is, it does not lend itself easily to a task graph 
 * implementation. <br>
 * Worse : because it works with \c #pragma, if we choose
 * to support OpenMP, then <i>the whole source code</i> has to be adapted, 
 * making it heavily dependent and bloated. 
 * It breaks one the essential "What if"s : "What if we want to change our
 * implementation ?".
 *
 * <b>What about Cilk ?</b><br>
 * No, for the same reasons as above.
 *
 * <b>What about IntelÂ® TBB ?</b><br>
 * I don't know. Sounds like a huge dependency to me, and I really don't
 * feel like writing a C binding for it. Nobody will mind you doing it though!
 *
 * <b>What about [insert thread library here] ?</b><br>
 * Interesting ! But it's pretty much pointless when we have SDL2.
 *
 * <b>How about binding C++'s <tt>std::thread</tt> to C calls ?</b><br>
 * Seems doable, but ugly. Plus it's not as widely supported as you'd expect 
 * from a so-called "standard feature".<br>
 * I'm pretty sure that even SDL2's routines are more portable.<br>
 * The whole thing is broken anyway. There's no such thing as
 * "standard threads" - most of the time they are just implemented with
 * \c pthread library calls, which in turn use OS-specific functions that
 * anybody could just use directly.<br>
 * Yeah, this ain't Java.
